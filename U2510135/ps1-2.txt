Pseudocode for Finding All Factors of a Positive Integer

Algorithm: FindFactors
Input: n (a positive integer)
Output: list of all factors of n

BEGIN
    Initialize empty list called factors
    
    FOR i FROM 1 TO n DO
        IF n MOD i == 0 THEN
            Add i to factors list
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    RETURN factors
END
